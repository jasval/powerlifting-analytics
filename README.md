First step before working with the data is to get it, for simplicity both files referenced in the Jupyter Notebook can be downloaded from the following link and put in the same directory than CleaningProcessNotebook.

Then follow the steps in the cleaning notebook to produce a clean dataset named by default 'data.csv' in your local directory.
If you want to contribute to this project open branches and add notebooks to work on the data, these will be reviewed and later merged to master.
